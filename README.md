# Project: Decrypt Libary
Hello and welcome to Project: Decrypt Libary. This project is brought to you by the one and only Calviar Corp; where we are unearthing the secrets of the cyber world today
Wait!...You seem like someone who could help us track him down...do you wish to assist us on our mission?

# What Is this Project?
Project: Decrypt Libary is a Vectorio side story which takes place in a new, unearthed reigon known as the "Sanctuary" discovered by Calviar Corperation.
The corperation has been tracking down a seemingly unkown force in this reigon that has been messing with thier systems; taking control of thier outpost, and even thier own Gaurdian Class units.
Your main job is to help the Corperation track down whatever is causing the problem and shut it down; though this isnt going to be easy.
