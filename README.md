# Project: Decrypt Libary
Hello and welcome to Project: Decrypt Libary. This project is brought to you by the one and only Calviar Corp; where we are unearthing the secrets of the cyber world today
Wait!...You seem like someone who could help us track him down...do you wish to assist us on our mission?

# What Is this Project?
Project: Decrypt Libary is a Vectorio side story which takes place in a new, unearthed reigon known as the "Sanctuary" discovered by Calviar Corp.
The corperation has been tracking down a seemingly unkown force in this reigon that has been messing with thier systems; taking control of thier outpost, and even their own Gaurdian Class units.
Your main job is to help the Corperation track down whatever is causing the problem and shut it down; though this isnt going to be easy.


# Faction: Etheria
The Etheria Faction composses of discarded units or ships by other companies; treating the Sanctum reigon as a dump site. Whatever was in this reigon managed to re-activate thier coding for its own protection and stop anyone who enters the Sanctum.
Gaurdians from Calviar have been seen roaming the area without being given a patrol point or objective; so the gaurdians have been deemed rouge...
