# Project: Decrypt Libary
Hello? Hello? Is anyone reciving this transmission? We are Calviar Corps, where we are trying to uncover the buried secrets in this little cyberspace called hone. We have found a new region that we have been exploring for quiet a while now, but something has gone terribly wrong. There should be a Decryption site somewhere where you can find the blueprints to the "Hallows"...If anyone gets this, please we need help...

# What Is this Project?
Project: Decrypt Libary is a Vectorio side story which takes place in a new, unearthed region known as the "Hallows" discovered by Calviar Corps.
Calviar Corps had discovered the "Harrowing Hallows" region a while back. Exploring it long enough they managed to re-activate what seems like a Guardian created by who-knows what. The Guardian (when it was awoken) had hijacked most of the bases and Guardian Class Units sent by company to explore the area.
In a desprate attempt to restore the project they sent out a SOS...and it reached you.

This is going to start out as a small practice project I'll do to home my skills on Vectorio; if you guys like it I'll expand on the story and add more :).
